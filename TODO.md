# TODO List / Things to add to viewstat

- [] onchange event listener for matchMedia polyfill (including IE-specific styleMedia replacement)
- [] error correction (such as automatically discarding stray values) in <code>viewstat.screen.getRefreshRate</code>
- [] perform actual data analysis in <code>viewstat.screen.analyzeRefreshRateAccuracy</code>, calcuating properties such as variance and estimating accuracy
- [] additional screen information, such as touch support and connected devices (mouse, keyboard)
